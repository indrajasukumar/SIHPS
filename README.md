## Idea
EcoRecycleHub is an innovative online platform dedicated to promoting responsible e-waste disposal by providing users with easy access to the nearest collection and recycling facilities. Through informative pop-ups, users are educated about the harmful components of e-waste and their detrimental effects on the environment and human health. By inputting the model of their old devices, users can earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered during recycling, incentivizing proper disposal practices. These credit points can be redeemed for rewards such as discounts on eco-friendly products or donations to environmental charities. With a focus on community engagement and partnerships with local governments and recycling facilities, EcoRecycleHub aims to foster a culture of sustainability and make a positive impact on our planet.
